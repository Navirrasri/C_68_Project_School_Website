          <p>We, at KURINJI are guided by this principle and also strongly believe that education is discipline 
             for the adventure of life. True education is not a purchasable commodity. It cannot be bought and sold. 
             Education is the apprenticeship of life. "KURINJI" blossomed symbolising rarity at Kavettipatty in Namakkal 
             on the vast stretches of 18 acres in 2000. "KURINJI" co-educational institutions impart good standard of education
             for both rural and urban students.<br>
            Sri Venkateswara Educational Trust runs these prestigious institutions. Sixteen Directors who act as the Governing Body, put forth their untiring efforts and enthusiasm for strong establishment, good administration and steady progress of "KURINJI". Of course, KURINJI is highly blessed with well-qualified and efficient Directors to enable the teaching staff as the torch bearers of wisdom, especially in their subjects. So they are like the guiding stars to KURINJI students to score centum. We pride ourselves on our students' success and ability to get admission into reputed medical and engineering colleges state wide and shine in all walks of life.<br /><br />In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer
                 Science (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It was made up of companies that wanted to work 
                 together to create Web standards and also improve the Web. It was quickly agreed that the technology should be free of
                  royalties and patents. Berners-Lee has served as director of this W3C since it was founded. In 1995 Microsoft produced
                   the first version of Internet Explorer and this commercial browser created enormous growth in websites and web users.
                    The Web was first used for e-commerce in 1997 <p>
